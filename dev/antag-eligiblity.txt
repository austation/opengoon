Basically, find all the roundstart antags that can appear in each mode!
Okay
Let's go!

Note: three antags specified in the config are NOT checked: alien, predator and wrestler.
alien/pred stuff appears to be removed, wrestler is a latejoin.
latejoins use a snowflake weighting system instead.

NOTE: possible double-weighting of wraiths and others. Investigate during testing. Can probably be fixed by commenting some lines in gameticker.dm

Traitor => [Traitor, Wraith]
Wizard => [Wizard]
Waldo => [Waldo]
Vampire => [Vampire, Wraith, Grinch]
Conspiracy(Spy and Conspiracy) => [Spy, Conspirator] - Note: this is a weird one. Both spy AND conspiracy have the same name sent to the API. Guess they weight together?
Spy_Thief => [Spy_Thief]
Revolution => [Head_Rev]
Corporate Restructuring => []
Nuclear Emergency => [Nukeop]
Monkey => []
Mixed (Action) => [Traitor, Changeling, Vampire, Spy_Thief, Werewolf, Wizard, Blob, Wraith, Grinch]
Mixed (Mild) => [Traitor, Changeling, Vampire, Spy_Thief, Wraith, Grinch]
AI Malfunction => []
Gang => [Gang Leader]
Football => []
Flock => [Flockmind]
Extended => []
Disaster => []
Changeling => [Changeling]
Blob => [Blob]
Battle Royale => [Battler] - Note: no weighting
Everyone-Is-A-Traitor Mode => [Traitor, Wraith] - Note: Actually uses weighting, even with 169 tots
