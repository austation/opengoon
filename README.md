# OpenGoon Project
Open source tools and code to get gooncode servers working. Currently includes an API implementation, along with SQL schema for the server, and for the API.

## Disclaimer
This is really really bad code and I don't really know what I'm doing (gooncode in a nutshell anyway lol), this is probably exploitable or some shit, and probably really bad.
But, I had to get back at bee somehow, I couldn't let them get away with close sourcing their gooncode fork. That wasn't going to happen.

My lord I copy pasted so much stuff.
And why yes, I did write out all my database queries instead of making a damn function for every query I make.

# Usage
Because it's PHP, usage is braindead simple, as long as you have a DB setup.
